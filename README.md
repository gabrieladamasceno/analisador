Mobile Network Log Analyzer on Android Devices in Python Language

In today's world, it is almost impossible to carry out everyday activities without using Mobile Communication Networks, whether through internet data or voice. The technologies to the functioning of these networks are evolving more and more quickly, with the main difference between each of them being the ability to provide services with greater efficiency. Among mobile communication devices are Android, whose operating system is open source. These devices generate text files, called logs, which indicate which events occurred in the system in a given time. Currently, one of the Telecommunications Engineer's functions is to analyze this type of file to identify the functioning or failures that may be occurring in mobile communication networks, however, this work is quite manual and time-consuming. Therefore, this Dashboard-type tool in Python programming language can assist in analyses and reports carried out by Telecommunications Engineers.
